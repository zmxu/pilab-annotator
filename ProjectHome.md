İ. Arı and Y. Açıköz, “Pinotator ile Hızlı İmge İşaretleme,” IEEE 19. Sinyal İşleme ve Uygulamaları Konferansı, Antalya, 2011.

This work aims to combine the image annotation efforts commonly spent in fields such as image processing and computer vision. A generic flow is proposed to improve the process of annotating images and gathering databases, which takes considerable time of the researchers, and an accompanying tool is presented. Sample scenarios for different use cases are taken into consideration to show the usage of the tool. The process of image annotation is planned to be automatized with the free tool, open for the use of researchers.


# Pinotator: Image Annotation Tool #

Pinotator is composed of two components: Landmark annotator and rectangle annotator.

It's written in Python and it requires numpy and PyQt. It works on a single source file which is self-explanatory.
